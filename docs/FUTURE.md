I intend to have models of a great variety of geometric and topological objects.

If you would like to see a particular shape that is not listed anywhere above feel free to fill out an [issue](https://github.com/PharaohCola13/geometric-models/issues) and

I am currently working on a geometric paper describing the physical geometry of a Scutoid.

On the development side, I am working towards a multi-OS application that can be installed and uninstalled (*if desired*) with ease. For Linux users, I am making an attempt to have the software installable from a PPA repository to use with the APT packaging manager. I am new to this so it might be a while.
