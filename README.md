Installation and Setup

The GUI is now a standalone desktop application!!!! You can simply go to

/build/[Your OS]/



and download the executable. I will continue to make bug fixes and updates to the application. As of now, it is a Linux/Windows application. However, I am working towards making it work for MacOS as well.
